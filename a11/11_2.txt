The greedy approach on solvin the acitivity selection problem, if solved on choosing the task with shortest duration time will certenly fail to produce the globally-optimal solution.
The constraint under which this greedy approach would work , would be that there is a correlation betwen the duration time and the finish time.
Otherwise, if we consider the following input as an example:
si	1	3	0	4	3	5	6	8	8	2	12
fi	4	6	6	7	8	9	10	11	12  13	14

The activity with the minimum duration time is activity nr. 11 (starting from index 1), but if we start with that activity, it is the only one we can perform as its starting time is 12, when all the other activities have already finished.
