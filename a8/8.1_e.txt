0.1 0.1 

0.3 

0.6 0.7 0.6 

0.9
The above is the content of each bucket in the bucketsort.cpp.
This can be considered as a kind of average case.
The worst case would be the onle where all the lements end up in one bucket:
0.6,0.7,0.0.58.....n=7
As we use std::vector to sort the buckets, it uses the introsort algorithms, which is a combination of quicksort,insertionsort, and heapsort.
All except heapsort have worst time complexity of n^2, so if all elements end up in one bucket and moreover are already sorted or inversely sorted the time complexity of bucketsort will be O(n^2).
